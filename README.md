### General Description

NFC click is a mikroBUS add-on board with a versatile near field communications controller from NXP — the PN7120 IC. NFC devices are used in contactless payment systems, electronic ticketing, smartcards, but also in retail and advertising — inexpensive NFC tags can be embedded into packaging labels, flyers or posters.

This board has full compliancy with NFC Forum specifications which means that you will be able to use the full potential of NFC and its three distinct operating modes:

- Card emulation
- Read/Write
- P2P

In other words, NFC click can be set to behave either as an NFC reader, or a tag, or to establish a two-way connection with another NFC device.
